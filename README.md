# Linux---Bash-File-System-Manager-project
Project in the course DVA233 at Mälardalens Högskola. 

Notation: I passed the course with this code with my lab partner. Looking back at it I would like to add parts of the code as seperate modules for easier management of the code.
Also create local variables for every part of the code, instead of creating empty variables at the very start (For some of the code). Which ends up leaving the code running with multiple empty variables which is not a good way to save memory thats being used on the device.
If I ever get the time off from university to edit this code, I will return and fix it. Otherwise I would just like people to look at this code and learn from it, and perhaps implement some of the parts in their own code.
